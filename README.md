# TicTacToe
An "Engine" for TicTacToe

The game now has a GUI. Just run `gui.py` with python3.

If don't have tkinter installed or you prefer old terminal style programs play the game running `ui.py` with python3.

The file `src/engine.py` is designed so you can make your own UI. The goal of the engine is to be unbeatable. So, far it hasn't been defeated. Let me know if you can beat it!


# Troubleshooting UI issues (Only if you run ui.py)
* Make sure to run UI.py in a sophisticated terminal. The default windows command prompt cannot print the text markups. So, it will end up looking like this:

* **If you want to turn markups off** set `markups = False` in the line 3 of `UI.py`. **Warning:** The output will get really eyestraining.

If you are on Linus/Mac this shouldn't be an issue.
On windows, I recommend using the app ***Windows Terminal*** available on Microsoft Store. Then the markups will be printed appropriately:

Alternatively, you can run this on VS Code terminal.
